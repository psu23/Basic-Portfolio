                    <section id="text">
                        <p>I am a web development student living in Philadelphia. I grew up in the suburbs of NYC, and 
                        got my BS in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. 
                        I then went to Drexel University, where I got my PhD in MSE. During this time, I discovered several new 
                        nanomaterials that have potential applications in quantum computers among others.</p>
                        
                        <p>During my experiences in academia and industry, I was exposed to coding languages including 
                        C++ and Matlab. Using these languages to answer puzzling questions taught me about
                        the powers of coding. My interest in design, however, fueled my passion for  
                        web development. Creating a better user experience, innovation and problem-solving are my motivations.</p>
                    
                        <p>Some of my other interests and hobbies are DJ-ing, music production, 
                        woodworking, furniture making, film history and film production.</p>
